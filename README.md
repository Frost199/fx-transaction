# Aza Finance technical assessment Solution

## Project Setup ‚öôÔ∏è

To run this project successfully, there are a few setup that needs to be done.

* Install [docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/)
  and [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)
* Make sure you have go installed too.
* Start docker either from the terminal or the desktop application, if it is not already started



## Run the project üèÉüèΩ

* Open the terminal
* Pull the repository
* `cd` into the project 
* In Your `base` terminal session, run `docker-compose up`, this build the images if it hasn't been built before, and start the services
* Migrations
  * You need to run the migration for this project
  * open a new terminal, `cd` into the base project and run `docker-compose run -d fx-transactions-service bin/rake db:migrate` this runs the migration into the container.
* Tests
  * To run the specified tests in the project
  * You need to run `docker-compose run -e "RAILS_ENV=test" fx-transactions-service bin/rails test` this runs the specified tests in the project
  
## Design Considerations, Decisions and Assumptions ü§î
* Service was containerized to help with easy setup and in the future for easy deployment.
* It was assumed that the customers are valid customers already, as our microservice does not concern itself with validating customers.
* Currency types are validated before they are saved into the database. here is a [link](https://gist.github.com/semmons99/852788) of the currencies I used for validation

## Project Improvements Implemented üîß

* Caching of requests: 
  * Requests are cache for an hour and this helps improve the response time for when a resource is requested.
* Pagination:
  * The fetching of all transactions is paginated and this helps to  reduce the size of the json object that is sent.
* DB Indexing:
  * Indexing frequently queried columns by, on th database helps in faster queries. here the `transaction_id`, `customer_id` rows are indexed.
